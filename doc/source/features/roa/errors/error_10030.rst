10030 - Unexpected database error
=================================

Whenever we try to retrieve / create / update / delete resources database exceptions related to constraint or
inconsistencies might appear. This case is treated in a friendly manner within ROA apis. You can find a sample example below:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"error_code": 10030,
    "error_description": "Resource /sample-reosource version 1.0 can not be created: DB unexpected exception.",
    "error_details": <link to this page>}
