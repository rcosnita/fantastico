Activate extension command
==========================

This Fantastico command helps developers integrate existing components into their project very easy. One use case is to activate
in your projects contrib components (e.g: :doc:`/features/components/dynamic_menu/dynamic_menu`). It
is strongly recommended to use this sdk command because it works on every support operating system.
